### Installation
After installing Python3 and Imagemagick, download "ImpressionMovieMaker.zip" and extract it. In the command prompt, navigate to the folder and "*pip install -r requirements.txt*"

Simply run ImpressionMovieMaker.py for a half-assed GUI experience.

For those who like it old-school (and nicer), a CLI interface exists ("*python ImpressionMovieMaker.py --help*" is your friend).
